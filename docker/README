This Dockerfile creates an image to reproduce our experimental results.

1. Preparation -- preload files

  The following files are required in the building process of JikesRVM.
    asm-3.0.jar
    checkstyle-4.3.tar.gz
    classpath-0.97.2.tar.gz
    ecj-3.2.jar
    hamcrest-all-1.3.0RC2.jar
    junit4.10.zip
    mockito1.9.5-rc1.jar

  DaCapo benchmark suites are also required to reproduce our experimental
  results.
    dacapo-2006-10-MR2.jar
    dacapo-9.12-bach.jar

  Please place these files in the externals directory.

2. Preparation -- copy source files.

  Copy the source tree of JikesRVM in the sapphire directory.

  % cp -r ../jikesrvm sapphire/

3. Run the container

  Build a docker image from this Dockerfile.

  % docker build -t sapphire .

  Then, a container of the created image.

  % docker run -ti sapphire

4. Execute DaCapo benchmarks with JikesRVM+Sapphire

  The docker build process in 2. builds JikesRVM in the /opt/sapphire/jikesrvm
  directory. We provide a script /opt/sapphire/benchmark to execute JikesRVM
  with the options that we used in our paper. This script is expected to
  be executed in the /opt/sapphire directory.
  
  % cd /opt/sapphire

  To execute pmd in DaCapo 9.12, for example,

  % ./benchmark -t pmd9 jikesrvm

  Executing this script without command line parameters displays
  all options and the list of available benchmark programs.
